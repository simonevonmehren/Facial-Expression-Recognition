# Facial-Expression-Recognition
Includes code written for Exam Project, Introduction to Intelligent Systems, DTU 2020. 
Authors: Natasha Norsker, Alma Fazlagic and Simone von Mehren.
Project: Creating a CNN-model to recognize facial expressions from grayscale 48x48 pixels images.
You can download the train.csv data file from https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data and create the test-, training- and validation sets used for our project using the python file "CreateData.py" in the repo.
Some parts of our code are modified versions of a CNN written for Facial Keypoint Detection (see link): https://github.com/nithiroj/facial-keypoints-detection-with-pytorch
